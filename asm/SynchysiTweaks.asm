; The following contains minor tweaks or optimizations to
; code Synchysi wrote in restrict-espers.asm and esper-
; changes.asm. 
;
; As it stands currently, the "Can't Equip!" message only
; works by fluke because X usually contains a specific text
; pointer (Esper description) – once I started messing around
; with that, it started claiming Terra had every esper due to
; an incompatible offset. The following changes shelter the Uneq
; routine from this issue. They also remove some redundant
; executions of the esper equippability routine by flagging a
; scratch variable with the equippability determination.
;
; Most of the code that follows is reproduced verbatim from
; their original sources, and I have done my best to note the
; portions that differ.

; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Manually disassembled and modified, commentary is my own.
; I eliminated one of the loops, and optimized the other slightly.
; The latter now also rolls the equippability bit onto a scratch
; variable instead of doing an AND on the LSB of A. This scratch
; variable is used in other places to determine equippability.
; This change is the foundation of everything else in this file.

; There are two notable changes in the following section.
;
; First, it flips the logic: check for unequippability, then
; assume a conflict if it's equippable (rather than checking for
; the conflicting name and then assuming it's unequippable if the
; letter is blank, which will only work for a pre-assumed X offset)
;
; This makes the "Can't Equip!" message much less prone to breaking
; due to unexpected X register values that are leftover from other
; operations.
;
; Second, it gets rid of the yucky JSR/PLX juju by JMPing in and out.
; If one execution branch ends in a JMP, might as well let them both.
; We have the space to spare, and it's only called in one place.
